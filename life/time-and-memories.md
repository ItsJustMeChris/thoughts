Life feels fast when you’re living it, stretched thin while it’s happening, and gone in a blink when you look back.

In the moment, everything feels urgent. Minutes collapse under the weight of attention, racing past while you’re too busy to notice. But when you’re stuck waiting, or struggling, or just drifting, time drags. Each second grows heavy. It stretches into something it never had any right to be.

Memory doesn’t play fair either. It edits. It cuts out the middle, the waiting rooms and the slow walks home, and leaves only the milestones behind. All the spaces between get swallowed up, and the story plays back faster than it lived.

It’s strange, being human. What we measure and what we feel rarely line up.

I think about school sometimes, things that happened fourteen years ago like they just ended. Then I think about someone I saw last week, and it feels like a month has passed. A good day at work can burn through hours like they’re nothing, but other days, it feels like you age a year between lunch and dinner. The future I dream about still feels impossibly far off, even when I know it isn’t.

The way time feels seems tangled up with emotion. Big feelings—fear, joy, sadness—stretch or crush the hours. Regular days just drift into the background, blending together until they’re hard to separate.

Happy moments feel huge while they’re happening, but somehow small looking back. Negative emotions hog the spotlight when we think about what’s ahead. Remembering the good takes effort, like reaching into deep water and pulling something up before it sinks.

Happiness fades fast. Sadness hangs on.

Most memories feel honest about who I was and what I lived through, but it’s the gaps that haunt me. The missing pieces in between the big moments. The plain, boring days we never thought we’d want to remember. Those days loom larger now. They feel like the real stuff of life.

I wonder why our brains aren’t better at saving them. Maybe they are, and we just have to be patient enough to find them again. I’ve tried before, chasing old memories down, and it feels like with enough patience, you can still find your way back to places you thought were lost.

If you really wanted to keep the mundane from fading, you’d probably have to do it on purpose. Write about it. Record it. Build bridges back to the smaller pieces of your life. Maybe someday, science will find a shortcut. Maybe there’ll be a way to unlock everything we’ve ever lived without lifting a finger.

But even then, would most people want it? Or are we too caught up in the now and the next to care about the long middle?

I don’t think getting access to all of it would change what we value. We’d still take it for granted, or we’d drown in it. Depends on how those memories end up bending time around us. Some people might start chasing bigger, louder memories, while others might finally learn to find joy in the quiet.

Not every important moment feels important when it’s happening. Sometimes the best memories aren’t the ones with fireworks. They’re the ones where nothing big happens at all. Just being near someone you love, not saying much, not doing anything special. Sitting on a couch. Sharing space.

If we could keep those moments forever, maybe we’d realize they were never small to begin with.

Maybe memory isn’t supposed to save everything. Maybe it’s enough that it saves anything at all.
