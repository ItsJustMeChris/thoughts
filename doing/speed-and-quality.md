# Doing Stuff: Move Fast, But Precise

There’s a myth that speed and precision are mutually exclusive. That in order to move fast, you must sacrifice thoughtfulness. And to be deliberate, you must move slowly. But that’s just not true.

The most effective builders, founders, and creatives move fast *because* they’re precise. They don’t waste time second-guessing every step. They’ve sharpened their instincts and tools. They know what matters—and act on it without hesitation.

## Speed isn’t rushing

Moving fast doesn’t mean being sloppy. It means avoiding indecision and overengineering. You’ve defined the goal clearly enough that the path forward feels obvious. You trim the fat. You take action. You iterate.

It’s the difference between a sprint and a stumble. One is focused momentum. The other is chaos.

## Precision isn’t perfection

Precision isn’t endless polishing at the end—it’s embedded in how you think and build. It’s the result of constraints, clarity, and taste. It’s knowing when “good enough” truly is—and when to push further.

It’s about hitting the target, not redrawing the bullseye after the arrow lands.

## The Junior–Senior Paradox

Junior developers often move quickly—sometimes recklessly—favoring speed over quality. It’s part of learning: testing limits, failing fast, figuring it out.

But over time, the pattern often flips. Senior developers become slower, more cautious. They’ve felt the pain of technical debt. They’ve seen what can go wrong.

But sometimes this becomes an overcorrection. Speed gives way to deliberation. Momentum turns into drag.

The goal isn’t speed *or* precision. It’s both. Move fast *and* with intent.

Burnout hits everyone eventually. But complacency can hit harder. It breeds stagnation—not wisdom. And stagnation cloaked in seniority isn’t mastery. It’s inertia.

## Fear at the Peak

I talk to a lot of seasoned developers—some of the best I know. Sharp minds, great instincts, bold ideas. Many of them want to build something of their own. Passive income. A SaaS tool. A game. Something outside the 9–5.

And often, they *start*. There’s excitement, validation, encouragement from peers. A working prototype. A clear market.

But then it stalls.

Even with a support loop—mutual hype, constant “you got this” energy—they still pull back. It feels risky. Expensive. Too far from comfortable.

That ambition, once a spark, becomes baggage. It weighs down momentum. The fear of failure overpowers the desire to build.

Not because they *can’t*—but because they *won’t*.

## Ship It Anyway

Instead of sitting on a clever idea—or even just something useful to *you*—put fingers to keys and ship it.

The cost? Maybe $20/month in hosting. Some time and focus.

The reward? Immense.

Getting something from idea to usable product—even if it helps just one person—is a milestone. It builds confidence. It creates momentum.

You don’t need to build a unicorn. Just solve a real problem. Make something useful. Finish something.

The internet doesn’t need more polished prototypes. It needs more finished tools.

Build like you’re lighting a signal fire. A small, clear flame that says, “I made this. I’ll make more.”

## Build Your Velocity

Speed and precision are both learnable. You can practice them. You can design your tools and systems to support them.

And you can choose to leap.

Move fast—but hit what you aim for.

That’s how you do stuff that matters.
